## [Explicit Group Sparse Projection with Applications to Deep Learning and NMF](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jIrOeWjdpc)
Implementation of [Explicit Group Sparse Projection with Applications to Deep Learning and NMF](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jIrOeWjdpc) published at Transactions of Machine Learning Research (TMLR) in 2022.

- The CIFAR-10 GSP code are in the `cifar` directory with a README  explaining how to run the code.
- The ImageNet GSP code are in the `imagenet` directory with a README explaining how to run the code.
- The Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) experiments are implemented in matlab and the files are available in the `nmf_matlab` directory and an identical version is also availabe [here](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasgillis/code?authuser=0#h.p_ID_44). Please, contact the repo maintainer if issues are faced running the matlab files.
